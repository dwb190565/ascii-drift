ðŸ§¬ Psychedelic ASCII Flow
A self-contained HTML experience that renders a chaotic, flowing mass of ASCII characters in motion. This experimental interface blends visual rhythm, symbolic abstraction, and glitch aesthetics into a hypnotic stream of typographic energy. Clicks, scrolls, and gestures can be layered to explore emergent patterns and digital entropy.

Ideal for generative art enthusiasts, ambient coders, and anyone seeking a browser-based trip through ASCII madness.
