🌀 ASCII Drift
ASCII Drift is a psychedelic, animated ASCII art experience rendered directly in the browser. It’s a meditative flow of cryptic symbols, glitchy bursts, and abstract motion—like a digital ritual unfolding in real time.

🔮 Features
Continuous ASCII Stream: Characters like ><()[]{}\\/|-=^v drift across the screen in hypnotic patterns.

Glitch Aesthetic: Occasional bursts of pseudo-text (?!CBBAAAAAAABBBCCC, BAZYXX$$$XXYYZZAAB) evoke a cryptic, cyber-mystic vibe.

Minimal Interface: No buttons, no menus—just pure visual flow.

Browser-Based: Lightweight and self-contained, ideal for ambient display or creative inspiration.

🧠 Inspiration
ASCII Drift explores the intersection of:

Emergent systems

Digital rituals

It’s designed to evoke trance, curiosity, and a sense of mythic abstraction.

🚀 Usage
Just open ascii-drift.vercel.app in your browser and let the drift begin.
